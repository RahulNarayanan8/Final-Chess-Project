# Final-Chess-Project
Final AP CS A project
Java swing

Because I am lacking in many mental capacities, my program is set up such that it creates the piece sprites based on images stored locally on me device. In order for others to run it you will need to save the pictures on your device and change the methods that get the piece types and colors such that they work properly for you.
